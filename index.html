      <p>There are several ways — most of them free — to support me and my work.</p>

      <p><strong>You might be thinking:</strong><br>
      <em>“But I already pay for your courses. Isn't that enough?”</em></p>

      <p>And yes — that support means the world to me. But one day, you — like many others I’ve appreciated and cared for — may move on. And when that happens, who will help those still learning?</p>

      <p><strong>SmarterGerman thrives through a constant flow of new learners.</strong> You may not think about that much, but here’s why it matters:</p>

      <div style="background-color: #f9f9f9; border-left: 5px solid #f59e0b; padding: 15px 20px; margin: 20px 0;">
        <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Accessibility matters:</strong><br>
        My courses are already affordable. If you're on a tight budget, you can apply for a <strong>“student discount”</strong> — no student ID needed — and pay only <strong>€9.90/mo</strong>. Still too much? There's also a <strong>€1/mo scholarship</strong>, in return for a short monthly progress report — just to stay accountable.</p>
      </div>

      <p>I love improving tools, refining your experience, and building powerful new exercises. But creativity needs time — and time needs funding. If I’m worried about money, I can’t focus fully on giving you the best learning journey.</p>

      <p>Even the <strong>full plan at €29.90/mo</strong> is a bargain compared to any serious competitor — and no, I’m not talking about apps with talking owls.</p>

      <div style="background-color: #e0f7fa; border-left: 5px solid #0097a7; padding: 15px 20px; margin: 20px 0;">
        <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>I care about your progress.</strong><br>
        I know what it’s like to feel stuck — to not want to study, especially German. I'm empathetic (though being from Northern Germany, also quite direct). I truly enjoy hearing about your wins, struggles, and setbacks — they help me make this course even better.</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Your support helps thousands of learners — not just me, not just you.</strong><br>
      Thank you for being part of this journey.</p>
